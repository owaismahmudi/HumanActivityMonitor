# HumanActivityMonitor
In this project we will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants (from devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit) and predict if the participant performed the exercises correctly or incorrectly. Please read README file for more details.
